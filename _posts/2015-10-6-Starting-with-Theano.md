title: Starting with Theano
---

**Hello everyone!**

Here we go, my first post. Since I am learning theano in order to approach my bioinformatics project, these first few posts will be related to the Theano tool.
Besides theano-posts, there will be posts related to the machine learning, neural networks, deep learning and bioinformatics sources I follow.

Okay, let's first briefly define what is Theano?

> Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.

Now we will start with the basic use of theano.

## *Get started with Theano:*

_Add two numbers together: (open python)_

```
          import theano.tensor as T
          from theano import function
          x = T.dscalar('x')
          y = T.dscalar('y')
          z = x + y
          f = function([x,y],z)
```
Not that you created your function, apply it:

```
          f(2,3)
        array(5.0)
          f(16.3, 12.1)
        array(28.4)
```

Okay, let's go now and see the explanation behind the function.


*While typing into an interpreter, you probably noticed the slight delay in executing the function instruction, that is because f function was compiled into C code.*

### Step 1 

```
          x = T.dscalar('x')
          y = T.dscalar('y')
```          
          
First step was to define two symbols(variables) representing the quntities thatyou want to add. The output of the function f is numpy.ndarray with zero dimensions. 


In Theano all symbols must be typed. 

>_T.dscalar is the type we assign to "O-dimensional arrays (scalar) of doubles (d)". It is a Theano Type._


dscalar is not a class, neither x nor y are actually instances of dscalar, they are instnces of TensorVariable. 
By calling T.dscalar, with a string argument, you created a Variable representing a floating-point scalar quantity with the given name. If you dont provide any argument, the symbol will remain unname, names are not necessary but are very helpful. 

### Step 2

```
          z = x + y
```
Combine the x and y into their sum z.
z is another Variable which represents the adition of x and y. 

>You can use pp() function to check the computational part of z. 

          print pp(z)
          (x + y)



### Step 3

```
          f = function([x,y], z)
```
Last step is to create a function taking x and y inputs and giving z as output. First argument of the function is the list of Variables, that will be the input of function. The second argument is a single Variable or a list of Variables, second argument is what we want to see as an output. 


### Extra
> Instead of step 3, you can use eval() method, it is not flexible as function() but it can do everything we covered.
It works this way:

```
          import theano.tensor as T
          x = T.dscalar('x')
          y = T.dscalar('y')
          z = x + y
          z.eval({x:16.3, y: 12.1})

       array(28.4)

```

### Adding two Matrices

*Let's add two matrices using theano*

```

          x = T.dmatrix('x')
          y = T.dmatrix('y')
          z = x + y
          f = function([x,y], z)
```


**dmatrix** is the type for matrices of doubles. 

So let's use our new function on 2D arrays:

```
          f([[1,2], [3,4]], [[10,20], [30,40]])
       array([[11., 22.], [33., 44.]])
```

We can also use the **NumPy array** as inputs:


```
          import numpy
          f(numpy.array([[1,2], [3,4]]), numpy.array([[10,20], [30,40]]))
       array([[11., 22.], [33., 44.]])
```

>It is possible to add scalars to matrices, vectors to matrices, scalars to vectors, etc. The behavior of these operations is defined by broadcasting.

          f = theano.function([a], out)  # compile function
          print(f([0,1,2]))
